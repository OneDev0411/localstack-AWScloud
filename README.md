# LocalStack - A fully functional local AWS cloud stack

![LocalStack](https://i.imgsafe.org/fe38108cd6.png)

**Please note: The main version of this repository is https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/localstack, please raise PRs against that repo.**

*LocalStack* provides an easy-to-use test/mocking framework for developing Cloud applications.

Currently, the focus is primarily on supporting the AWS cloud stack.

*LocalStack* spins up the following core Cloud APIs on your local machine:

* **API Gateway** at http://localhost:4567
* **Kinesis** at http://localhost:4568
* **DynamoDB** at http://localhost:4569
* **DynamoDB Streams** at http://localhost:4570
* **Elasticsearch** at http://localhost:4571
* **S3** at http://localhost:4572
* **Firehose** at http://localhost:4573
* **Lambda** at http://localhost:4574
* **SNS** at http://localhost:4575
* **SQS** at http://localhost:4576


Additionally, *LocalStack* provides a powerful set of tools to interact with the cloud services, including
a fully featured KCL Kinesis client with Python binding, simple setup/teardown integration for nosetests, as
well as an Environment abstraction that allows to easily switch between local and remote Cloud execution.

## Requirements

* `make`
* `python`
* `pip` (python package manager)
* `npm` (node.js package manager)
* `java`/`javac` (Java runtime environment and compiler)

## Installation

To install the tool and all its dependencies, run the following command:

```
make install
```

This will install the required pip dependencies in a local Python virtualenv directory 
`.venv` (your global python packages will remain untouched), as well as some node modules
in `./localstack/node_modules/`. Depending in your system, some pip/npm modules may require
additional native libs installed.

## Testing

The project comes with a set of unit and integration tests which can be kicked off via a make
target:

```
make test
```

## Running the infrastructure

The Makefile contains a target to conveniently run the local infrastructure.

```
make infra
```

Then you can point your `aws` CLI to use the local infrastructure, for example:

```
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4568 kinesis list-streams
{
    "StreamNames": []
}
```

If you are accessing the cloud APIs from within yout Python code, you can also use `boto3` and use
the `endpoint_url` parameter to connect to the respective service on `localhost`.
See `localstack.utils.aws.aws_stack` for convenience methods to connect to the local services.

## Integration with nosetests

If you want to use *LocalStack* in your integration tests (e.g., nosetests), simply fire up the
infrastructure in your test setup method and then clean up everything in your teardown method:

```
from localstack.mock import infra

def setup():
    infra.start_infra(async=True)

def teardown():
    infra.stop_infra()

def my_app_test():
    # here goes your test logic
```

See the example test file `tests/test_integration.py` for more details.

## Web Dashboard

The projects also comes with a simple Web dashboard that allows to view the
deployed AWS components and the relationship between them.

```
make install-web
make web
```

## Contributing

We welcome feedback, bug reports, and pull requests!

For pull requests, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Add tests for any new features and bug fixes. Ideally, each PR should increase the test coverage.
* Follow the existing code style (e.g., indents). A PEP8 code linting target is included in the Makefile.
* Put a reasonable amount of comments into the code.
* Separate unrelated changes into multiple pull requests.
